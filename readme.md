# MacOS workstation setup script

A shell script to setup a required minimum of basic tools I use in my daily activities. Inspired by [laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) script by Thoughtbot.

## Compatibility

- Tested on macOS 10.15.3

## Installation

Clone repository, run script.

    bash mac.sh

It is safe to run script multiple times if needed (the packages will be updated in case they are already installed). It may ask for sudo password during the execution (homebrew installation, ruby gems installation, etc.).
